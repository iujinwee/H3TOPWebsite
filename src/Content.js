The 5 of them eventually find each other at the centre of the city as there is a giant, neon billboard flashing an eerie announcement:",

He has an IQ higher than stephen hawking and albert einstein combined. He can win Connect 4 in 3 moves. He has never lost a scissors-paper-stone match.

        story: "The wild, fearless and mythical beast Bankai is a Japanese kitsune with mind-channelling abilities like Telekinesis. With sharp steel claws and a ring of black fur around its cunning eyes, Bankai’s appearance is certainly daunting and even the slightest glimpse of it in the woods has scared many travellers away. Bankai will stop at nothing to ensure survival, including manipulating his enemies and gaslighting them into doing what he wants. He was also blessed with the ability to breathe fire when he is in a rage, which has burned down entire towns and cities in the past . Currently, he resides in the kingdom of Borderland, where he has established his dominance and gathered respect from all the civilians. However, his latest threats are the 4 new beasts that have recently entered his kingdom and the land that he reigns - Akari, Chakra, Doku and Enji.",

        quirk: "Spirit Dragon",
        story:"No one knows how this being first came into existence. Few who encountered it have lived to tell the tale, and only brief descriptions of the creature exist in legends. It is said to emit so much energy during battles that victims lucky enough to survive an encounter with it have nicknamed the beast “Chakra”. Legend says that the beast was the main reason dinosaurs went extinct when it first came to Earth, and has since gone into slumber in the deepest part of the Earth’s oceans as it was the only place capable of containing its flames. Ever since the dinosaurs, no living beings which came after have been strong enough to entertain it in battle, so the beast rests in the depths awaiting the day it can finally encounter a challenge again. In the meantime, he sends out a part of his spirit with all attributes maxed during character selection to walk the Earth in search of his next challenger."

    Doku: {
        name: "Doku",
        quirk: "Venomous Snake",
        story: "Our character is named “Doku” which means poisonous in Japanese. We decided to name our character, “Doku”, as it is fierce, reckless and a formidable force, just like the characters in “Alice in Borderland”. “Doku” is a powerful character that is ever-ready to overcome challenges with the snap of a finger. Using its poison and quick-thinking skills, its enemies simply stand no chance of surviving against “Doku”. In addition, the poker card that ties in with our character is symbolic of the risks “Doku” is ready to take in order to gain victory and it ties in well to the idea of poker cards used in the series “Alice In Borderland”."

    Enji: {
        name: "Enji",
        quirk: "Vengeful Samurai",
        story: "Enji was nurtured in the highlands by his father, Injuto. On one dreadful night, his tribe was attacked, and Enji saw his father murdered right in front of his eyes. Enji was fortunate to avoid death, but the flashbacks of his father's death haunts him to this day. Enji swore vengeance and vowed to eliminate anybody who stood in his way. Enji is portrayed as a greedy, egotistical man who takes satisfaction in being 'in charge' behind the scenes. He believes in the art of hypnosis and revels in the fact that he can control and manipulate players to his liking in the Borderlands. He was well aware that Akari, Banzen Chakra, and Doku were his main adversaries and is determined to kill all of them. Will Enji succeed in getting revenge for his father?"
